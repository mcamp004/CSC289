					<p class="eventinfo"> Each month we will celebrate the growth in the Garden 
					by putting on several events. These special events will not only highlight the 
					progress of our garden but also add a social element. Growing vegetables to place 
					healthy options at the dinner table, is now a convenient option. We encourage
					parents to bring their kids, to get them familiar with many varieties of vegetables. 
					The community garden will also have varieties of herbs and flowers to bring our garden
					full circle.
				
					The elements created throughout the garden inspires our special events. Our canvas (garden)
					has exponential potential of lush foliage and veggies.</p>

				   Green Front Community Garden provides a way for people to serve the surrounding
				   communities and the environment. Carving out spaces to grow garden enhances the soil
				   and creates great ecosystems for pollination. Not to mention, gardening is considered
				   to be therapeutic. Each month we will update the event postings. We also send out pretty 
				   digital flyers, straight to your inbox.
				   If you know a company or run one, and you like to sponsor an event contact us!</p>
